# DVWA SQL Injection Detection

This project is a Python script that demonstrates how SQL injection vulnerabilities can be detected safely and legally using an intentionally vulnerable test application.

It is designed to be run **only** against DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App) running locally on your own machine.

## What This Script Demonstrates

This script shows how to:

  - Send input to a website automatically using Python
  - Compare normal input vs unexpected input
  - Detect when a website behaves incorrctly
  - Identify a possible SQL injection vulnerability

**This is not about hacking real websites.**

It is about learning how vulnerabilities happen and how they can be detected.
